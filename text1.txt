We need a release directory for deploying the IBPS application on both the UAT and Replica servers. Inside this directory, we require the application files along with a 'release.txt' file. The 'release.txt' file should contain a list of the application files and their respective target locations.

Could you please coordinate with Angad/Nikhil to set this up?
