This request for we have to deploy the IBPS application from Ansible server to WAS server. But we don’t have the sudo permission for this deployment activities that’s why we asking to create a new switch user permission with application server and Database server and Unix team created the new user with Unix server for the application but database server is running with windows server. So we need same request for Database server. So kindly create new switch new user with Database (Windows) server.
