I am doing IBPS deployment using with Ansible, previously secured using an Ansible Vault key for authentication, has been implemented successfully. However, we now have a requirement to transition from the Ansible Vault key to a new authentication method, which involves the use of SSH keys, along with a username and password.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this change in authentication methods further. 

Could we schedule a meeting at your earliest convenience to delve into the details and address any questions or concerns you may have regarding this transition?
