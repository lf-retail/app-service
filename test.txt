Our Ansible deployment, initially secured with an Ansible Vault key for authentication, has been successfully implemented. However, there is a need to transition to a new authentication method involving SSH keys, along with a username and password.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this change in more detail. Could we schedule a meeting to go over the specifics?
