I have completed the IBPS deployment on below UAT2 cluster servers. This involved downloading the release artifact from Github Releases and copying it onto the targeted servers from the Runner machine. Additionally, I ensured that the application files within the release artifact were copied to their respective locations as specified in the release.txt file.

Here are the details for the two servers:

Application: ANTIBPSAPP1
IP: 10.15.11.209

Application: ANTIBPSAPP2
IP: 10.15.11.210

Additionally, Today had a discussion with Devdutta Singh, Anisur Rahman Abdul Kalam Shaikh, and Hritik Kounsal regarding the installation of WAR files in WAS,. We discussed the necessary steps to follow if there are any WAR files within the release artifact. I'm scheduled to commence this work on Monday.

Please feel free to reach out if there are any additional requirements or if I've overlooked anything.
======================

Could you please share the test environment details needed to test the script for installing WAR files in WAS?
